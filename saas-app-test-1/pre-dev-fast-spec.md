## Executive Summary

Wynter-style Messaging Scorecard SaaS: Next.js + Vercel app that lets founders paste a page URL and instantly receive a messaging scorecard using LLM heuristics (Clarity, Differentiation, Proof, Emotion). Users set page type (home/product/pricing), system fetches and extracts copy, runs OpenAI-based analysis, and returns overall score, subscores, top issues, and rewrite suggestions. UI supports inline before/after edits, save to projects, history/deltas, CSV/PDF export, and shareable links. Pricing: Starter $29/mo (1 domain, exports, share links); Pro $59/mo (5 domains, history+deltas, webhook, brand terms); Add-on $99/mo brand tracking with weekly crawls, competitor comparison, alerts, share-of-message diff. Tech stack: Next.js App Router, Tailwind, Server Actions, node-fetch + Readability, Turso/LibSQL or Supabase, Clerk/NextAuth, Stripe, Vercel cron, optional Upstash Redis. Schema includes projects, pages, audits, competitors. API: POST /api/audit returns overall, subscores, issues {type, why, severity}, rewrites {section, before, after}. Expected outcomes: fast, actionable messaging feedback for founders, collaborative editing, track improvements over time, scalable on Vercel.

## Core Functionalities

- **URL Fetch & Content Extraction**: Fetch provided page URLs, parse HTML using Readability to extract main copy and structure for analysis. (Priority: **High**)
- **LLM Heuristics Scoring Engine**: Run OpenAI prompts to evaluate Clarity, Differentiation, Proof, Emotion and produce overall score, subscores, issues, and rewrite suggestions per section. (Priority: **High**)
- **Audit Management & Versioning**: Save audits to projects, support inline before/after edits, track history and deltas, and enable export (CSV/PDF) and shareable links. (Priority: **High**)
- **Billing & Access Controls**: Implement Stripe billing with tiered plans, enforce domain and feature limits, and provide authentication via Clerk/NextAuth. (Priority: **Medium**)
- **Scheduled Brand Tracking & Alerts**: Optional add-on for weekly crawls, competitor comparison, alerts, and share-of-message diff using Vercel cron and Redis job queue. (Priority: **Medium**)
